#  Threat Intelligence Aggregator (Non-AI)

##  Project Overview

This project implements a Threat Intelligence Aggregator designed to collect, parse, normalize, correlate, and generate blocklists from multi-source IOC feeds without using Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning.

The system processes CSV, TXT, and JSON feeds and produces actionable intelligence outputs for defensive security controls.



##  Key Features

- Multi-format IOC feed ingestion
- IP, Domain, and URL validation
- Duplicate removal & normalization
- Enterprise-level risk scoring
- Severity classification (Low / Medium / High / Critical)
- Automated blocklist generation
- Deployment-ready output files
